QWLA is a tiny quantum circuit simulator written in Python.
The goal of QWLA, as the title suggests, is to present quantum computing without using linear algebra.
Instead, QWLA represents a quantum state as a dictionary and applies operations in a functional style, using map, filter, reduce, etc.

## technical details
For all technical details and an introduction to quantum computing without the linear algebra, see the [accompanying paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2025/1091.pdf).

## structure
- The `state.py` file contains the `State` class, which is a quantum state and supports a number of operations (Clifford + T).
- There are example circuits in the `examples/` folder.


## usage
The easiest way to use QWLA is with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).
To run an example, simply:

```bash
uv run examples/epr.py
```
